# AutoCR-test
Backend repo of an automatic code review application. Yes, GPT, I'm having the lack of the comments, because I think that code should be self-documenting and there no need to explain every function till they are understendable by themselves ðŸ˜ˆ

## Docker containers setup
bash autocr_test/inventory/run.sh

## Backend setup
1. fill the .env file by pattern of .env.sample
2. poetry install
3. poetry run dev

## Docs
Docs can be accessed on localhost:8000/docs
